It permits planning an afternoon’s work or planning a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The difficulty of obtaining information about buried utility lines is that nothing is visible. Drawings, plans, or information should always be obtained but they may be faulty or incomplete. A suitable technique has to be used to obtain the information from the underground.</p><p>We use <strong>Electromagnetic location</strong>, a method of locating buried pipes, cables, and sewers and it has become almost universal. Its main shortcoming is that it will not locate non-metallic lines such as plastic pipes. However, utilities taking a small amount of trouble to lay tracer wires with plastic pipes are not affected by this shortcoming. </p>",
